# scripts
Useful scripts I use on a daily basis (Github version! for Gitlab specific go [here](https://gitlab.com/filipefreire/scripts))

## How to use

1. clone the project to `$HOME` dir
2. rename scripts folder to `.scripts`
3. add export of scripts path to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file
```
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.scripts"
```

## dotrc file

`dotrc` file is where I keep the usual alias and other functions that can be added to `.bashrc` and `.zshrc`
